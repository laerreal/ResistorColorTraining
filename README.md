# Resistor Color Reading Training Utility

## Usage

```
git clone ... rct
python3 rct
```

It shows randomly generated resistor color mark.
User should input corresponding value.
E.g.: `22k+5` or `22000+5`.
There `+5` is resistor tolerance (i.e. +/-5%).
If there is an error then a message is shown before next color
mark is generated.
